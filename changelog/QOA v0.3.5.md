# QOA v0.3.5 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 20/8/2025

## Summary

QOA v0.3.4 enhances distributed node rendering features using SIMD optimizations and other general bug fixes.

## Improvements

- Fixed Many bugs especially VK/GPU related ones
- Improved SIMD in node.rs
- node.rs *should* handle LAN and Internet compute now

## Notes

* Node rendering still in experimental development, not stable enough I'd rely on it.
* GPU acceleration still in development.
* Vulkan probably still broken

### This is not a major update, just some bug fixes and node.rs improvements that I'd thought were important enough to have its own update. 

**Thank you for using QOA.**
