# QOA v0.2.9 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 05/07/2025  
**Status:** Pre Release

## Summary
QOA v0.2.9 focuses on minor code improvements and finishing what I have on my `TODO.md`.

## Changes

### Things I Added:
- **Implemented `LABEL` instruction:** The `LABEL` instruction is now fully implemented in `src/instructions.rs`, serving as a non-operation (nop) instruction in the bytecode, but crucial for defining jump targets for future control flow instructions like `JMP` and `CALL`.
- **Added QOA System Requirements ReadMe**

### Things I Improved:
- **Update on README.md**
- **Update on TODO.md (Almost done!!!)**

### Things I Fixed:
- **Minor Visualizer & main.rs bugs**

## Migration of old QOA source files:
- **Recompiling Required:** For all source files, including an updating of Syntax, if Possible.

## Notes
- **v0.3.0 will be everything I will finish on the TODO list, it might take a while because it needs to be done properly**

### Thank you for using QOA!
