# QOA v0.3.4 Release Notes

**Release Date:** 13/8/2025

**Status:** Stable Release

## Summary

QOA v0.3.4 introduces distributed node rendering capabilities and continues expanding platform support
with enhanced network optimization features.

## New Features (In Development)

### Distributed Node Rendering

* **`node.rs` Module** - Core distributed simulation engine for quantum state rendering across multiple nodes:
 - High-performance TCP networking with multi-stream connections
 - Zero-copy operations and compression support
 - Work-stealing thread pools for optimal load distribution
 - Adaptive load balancing with performance monitoring
 - NUMA-aware memory management
 - Heartbeat monitoring and fault tolerance

* **Network Optimizations** - Advanced networking stack including:
 - Batched message transmission with automatic flushing
 - Multiple concurrent streams per node connection
 - Configurable socket buffers and TCP optimizations
 - Support for RDMA and shared memory backends (planned)
 - Network metrics collection and monitoring

### Rendering Pipeline

* **Distributed Visualization** - Multi-node quantum state visualization:
 - Parallel rendering across cluster nodes
 - SIMD-optimized probability calculations using Rayon
 - Struct-of-arrays (SoA) layout for improved cache performance
 - Support for multiple visualization types (Probability, Bloch, Wigner)
 - Chunked work distribution with priority queuing

## Technical Improvements

### Memory Management

* **Custom Allocators** - NUMA-aware memory allocation for large quantum states
* **State Caching** - Caching of quantum state vectors across nodes
* **Zero-Copy Transfers** - Linux sendfile() support for data movement

### Synchronization

* **Multiple Sync Modes** - Flexible synchronization strategies:
 - Traditional barrier synchronization
 - Lock-free coordination
 - Optimistic concurrency control
 - Eventually consistent updates

## Platform Support

* **Linux Enhancements** - io_uring support and TCP fast open
* **Cross-Platform** - Continued work on non-x86 architectures

## Notes

* GPU acceleration still in development.
* The distributed architecture targets high-qubit simulations (20+ qubits) across multiple machines
* Future releases will include MPI backend support and GPU acceleration integration
* Documentation and examples will be added as the feature stabilizes

**Thank you for using QOA.**
