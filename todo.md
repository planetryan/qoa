# QOA Release v0.3.0 Development TODO

**THIS TODO LIST WILL DECREASE IN SIZE AS I FINISH IT**

## Lower Priority: Advanced Features, Robustness & Developer Experience

### Quantum State Management
- Add serialization/deserialization of quantum state and registers for checkpoints
- Add validation to detect corrupted quantum states
- Optimize memory usage for large qubit simulations

### Testing & Validation
- Write unit tests for all instructions and quantum operations
- Write integration tests for complex programs, including fusion simulation
- Add performance benchmarks for quantum operations
- Automate tests for edge cases, errors, and memory profiling

### Documentation & Examples
- Develop tutorials for fusion simulation and quantum programming
- Provide guides for troubleshooting, debugging, and performance optimization

### Control Flow & Program Structure
- Implement `LABEL` instruction for named jump targets
