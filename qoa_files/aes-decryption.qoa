; --- grover iteration (for n=26, many iterations are optimal) ---
; the number of iterations for grover's is approximately (pi/4) * sqrt(2^n).
; for n=26 (2^26 states), sqrt(2^26) = 2^13 = 8192.
; (pi/4)*8192 ~ 6434 iterations are required for optimal probability.
; this example shows only one conceptual iteration.

; --- step 2: oracle (phase oracle for the "secret key") ---
; the oracle applies a -1 phase to the amplitude of the target state.
; for a 26-bit aes key, this oracle would be an incredibly complex
; quantum circuit implementing the aes encryption function in reverse
; and marking the state that decrypts to a known plaintext.
; the specific oracle logic is omitted here due to its complexity.

; placeholder for oracle:
; in a real grover's for aes, this section would contain the quantum circuit
; that performs the aes decryption on the superposition of keys and
; applies a phase flip to the ancilla qubit if the key is correct.

; --- step 3: diffusion operator ---
; the diffusion operator amplifies the target state's amplitude.
; for n=26, this involves hadamards, x gates, and a multi-controlled z gate
; (mcz) on all 26 data qubits, controlled by the ancilla.
; the full decomposition of a 26-qubit mcz is extremely complex and omitted.

; apply x gate to all data qubits (q0 to q25)

; multi-controlled z gate on data qubits (q0-q25) controlled by ancilla (q26)
; this would be a very large decomposition of cnot and rz gates.
; for example, a general n-qubit mcz can be decomposed into 2n-1 cnot gates and 2n-1 rz gates.
; for 26 qubits, this would be 51 cnot and 51 rz gates, plus additional ancillae if not in-place.
; the specific decomposition is omitted for brevity.
