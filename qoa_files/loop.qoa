; one qubit to act as an 8-bit register
QINIT 0

;  for char values 0 to 255
;  this would be unrolled or handled by the emulator

; Example: each CHARLOAD loads a value, QMEAS measures it
; In real qoa this would be done using gate sequences but simulate it here

CHARLOAD 0 0
QMEAS 0

CHARLOAD 0 1

CHARLOAD 0 2

; Continue up to: 255
