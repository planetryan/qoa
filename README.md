# The Quantum Optical Assembly Programming Language



I have created this guide for researchers, developers and students who will use QOA in practial applications, I have designed it to interact with Quantum and/or Optical systems in the same way classical risc syntax based assembly could manipulate electrons in transistors. I hope whoever reads this guide finds it useful.

# What does the above program listed do?

This QOA program performs a three qubit Quantum Fourier Transform (QFT), a fundamental algorithm in quantum computing, and translates the results into optical signals. It initializes three qubits, prepares them in superposition using Hadamard gates, applies controlled phase shifts to encode frequency components, and then reverses their order to complete the QFT. After measuring the quantum state into classical registers, the program modulates optical channels based on these measurements. It then combines the modulated signals through interference and displays the result optically. A hybrid control signal is triggered conditionally based on the quantum measurements, showcasing the integration of quantum logic with optical output.

# What does the above program listed do?

This QOA program implements an optical network switch that selectively converts one of several incoming optical signals into an electrical signal based on a classical routing directive. It begins by initializing optical input channels and their corresponding optical-to-electrical converters. After capturing signals from all optical inputs, the program compares the routing value stored in a classical register to determine which optical input should be processed. It then modulates the selected optical signal into an electrical form and outputs it through a memory mapped interface for further classical use. The program is designed to bridge quantum and/or (mostly) optical hardware with traditional digital control logic, enabling dynamic reconfiguration of signal pathways in hybrid optical electronic systems, like optical network interfaces.

# What does the above program listed do?

This version loads a pattern for Grover's algorithm from theroetical quantum memory addresses QM1000 to QM1999 into the pattern register P0, simulating a hardware style memory fetch instead of embedding a pattern inline. This is more consistent with scalable systems and architectures where quantum memory modules store pre encoded targets or configurations.

# What does the above program listed do?

This QOA code represents a low level quantum program to factor an RSA modulus using Shor’s Algorithm. It loads both the modulus and a chosen base value from quantum memory, performs modular exponentiation, applies a Quantum Fourier Transform to find the periodicity, and measures the result to obtain the period, which can be used to derive the prime factors classically.
The entire execution takes place exclusively on a quantum computer, with no classical/optical or external data transfer until after the quantum measurement. The classical GCD and modular checks would happen post-measurement, either through a quantum classical hybrid interface or deferred to another QOA sequence.

This is all for now. QOA is still being modeled and developed solely by me, and any practical applications would not be relevant until optical and quantum systems become more commonplace. As these technologies mature and gain wider adoption, qoa aims to provide a unified low level assembly language capable of efficiently programming and controlling purely optical, purely quantum, or hybrid quantum-optical computing platforms. Until then, qoa remains my theoretical passion project focused on laying the groundwork for future advancements in these future fields of computing
